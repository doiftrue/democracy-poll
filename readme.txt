### More Info ###

Democracy Poll is a modernized version of an earlier, well-regarded plugin by the same name. Although the original plugin by Andrew Sutherland hadn't been updated since 2006, it introduced the innovative concept of allowing users to add their own answers. This version retains the core idea and name but features completely rewritten code.

Key features include:

* Creating new polls.
* Compatibility with cache plugins like WP Total Cache and WP Super Cache.
* Allowing users to add their own answers (optional).
* Multi-voting, enabling users to select multiple answers (optional).
* Automatically closing polls after a pre-set end date.
* Displaying random polls when multiple are available.
* Restricting polls to registered users (optional).
* Convenient admin tools, such as an "Edit" button for quick poll management.
* Editing the number of votes.
* Allowing users to change their votes when the re-vote option is enabled.
* Remembering voters via IP, cookies, or WordPress profiles. Optionally, vote history can be cleared.
* Embedding polls in posts with the `[democracy]` shortcode. A visual editor button is available for ease of use.
* Providing a widget (optional).
* Streamlined poll management through the WordPress toolbar (optional).
* Flexibility to disable or embed CSS/JS files into the HTML.
* Adding notes under polls for additional context.
* Customizing poll designs with CSS themes.

Multisite support is available starting from version 5.2.4.

Requires PHP 5.3 or later.


== Usage ==

### Usage (Widget) ###
1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Appearance -> Widgets` and select the `Democracy Poll` widget.
2. Add the widget to an available sidebar.
3. Configure the widget settings and save.
4. Done!

### Usage (Without Widget) ###
1. Open the `sidebar.php` file of your theme: `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/sidebar.php`.
2. Insert the following code where you want the poll to appear:

```php
<?php if( function_exists('democracy_poll') ){ ?>
	<li>
		<h2>Polls</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><?php democracy_poll();?></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
<?php } ?>
```

* To display a specific poll, use `<?php democracy_poll( 3 ); ?>`, where 3 is your poll ID.
* To embed a specific poll in a post, use `[democracy id="2"]`, where 2 is your poll ID.
* To embed a random poll in a post, use `[democracy]`.

#### Display Archive ####
To display the polls archive, use the function:
```php
<?php democracy_archives( $hide_active, $before_title, $after_title ); ?>
```
